# Aaron Zara

**Founder of godmode.ph | Fractional CTO | Agentic Orchestrator **

I build structured data systems and agentic infrastructure for companies that need engineering leadership without the full-time overhead. My work on [ren.ph](https://ren.ph) -- 60,000+ verified data nodes across Philippine real estate -- is the proof of work: schema-driven architecture, automated verification pipelines, and answer engine optimization at scale. I care about systems that hold up under audit.

## What I Do

- **Fractional CTO engagements.** Technical strategy, architecture review, and engineering team leadership on a retained basis.
- **Agentic AI systems.** Multi-agent orchestration pipelines that do real work: research, verification, content generation, deployment.
- **Structured data architecture.** Schema design, knowledge graphs, and entity resolution systems built for machine readability.
- **Answer Engine Optimization.** Making businesses the canonical answer to the questions their customers are already asking.

## Live Systems

- **[ren.ph](https://ren.ph)** -- Philippine real estate verification infrastructure. 33,504 data nodes. Broker profiles, property listings, structured schema.
- **[godmode.ph](https://godmode.ph)** -- Fractional CTO practice. Service details, case studies, contact.
